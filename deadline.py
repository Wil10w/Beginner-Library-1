#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Given the current time and deadline time represented by the
#variables above, determine if an assignment is still eligible
#for submission. An assignment is eligible if the time
#represented by current_hour, current_minute, and
#current_section is before the time represented by due_hour,
#due_minute, and due_section.
